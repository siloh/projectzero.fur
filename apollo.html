	<h2> my characters backstory: </h2>
	 <p>
	Apollo was born on a space ship, it crashed onto earth.
	Apollos mother died and his father was all ready dead... 
	Apollo suffered an injury to his heart and was dying when a strange creature 
	named siloh approached him ,
	she was an alien test subject and escaped from a lab...
	. she had two hearts ( one a nucular reactor, one a biological heart)
	and gave Apollo her spare ... the two eventually fell in love and traveled together,
	siloh gave Apollo every thing he wanted, Apollo gave siloh every thing she wanted....
	Siloh is infertile, so Apollo could never have a child , that was ok for the both of them, 
	they lived happily together.... forever....</p>
